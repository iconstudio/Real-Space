HOW TO PUT THE GAMES ON YOUR SITE

Upload these files including all subdirectories to an appropriate
place on your web server.  Examine the example html file to see
the <applet .....></applet> tag pair needed to run the game.
Place these tags in the appropriate html on your site.


IF YOU ARE AN AFFILIATE

If you are an affiliate of ours, you may embed your affiliate id into the game
by adding a param value to the applet tags in your html.  The following example
shows placing the affiliate id 1234.  Substitute the sample 1234 value with your
valid affiliate id.

<applet....>
<param name="moreurl" value="&aid=1234">
</applet>


JAVA APPLET CODEBASE TAG

Some webmasters need to host the game files in a different directory or on a different
web server than that of the web page which displays the game.  Use the applet
codebase tag to specify the subdirectory or full url where the game files
are actually hosted from.  Here are a couple examples.

<applet...  codebase="somedir/">
</applet>

<applet...  codebase="http://www.yoursite.com/somedir/">
</applet>
